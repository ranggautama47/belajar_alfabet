# 📚 Alphabet Learning & CSS Layout Simulation

This repository was developed as part of the Fundamental Front-End Web Development curriculum. It features two distinct tools: an educational application for learning the alphabet and a technical simulator for CSS Flexbox layouts.
# 🚀 Key Features

## 1. Alphabet Learning (index.html)

An interactive application designed to help beginners or children recognize letters through visual aids and word examples.

    Letter List: Clear display of uppercase and lowercase letters.

    Pronunciation Guide: Text-based guidance on how to pronounce each letter.

    Visual Examples: Paired with relevant images (e.g., Ayam for A, Bantal for B) to enhance memory retention.

    Responsive Design: Fully optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.

## **Preview:**

## 2. Flex Basis Simulation (Flex_Basis_Simulation.html)

A visual playground for web developers to understand how flex-basis and flex-direction properties interact within a CSS Flexbox container.

    Interactive Switcher: Change flex directions (row, column, etc.) in real-time.

    Live Feedback: Immediately see how the .box element responds to size and direction changes.
